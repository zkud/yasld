Yet Another Simple Lisp Dialect

## Presequencies
You should have both rust (2018 edition) and node js 14 installed

## Short intro
Please check the documentation for a implemented dialect in the dialect.md
This is a simple cross-compiler from the dialect to JavaScript, to use it just compile this project with a release tag,
create a file (for instance test.lsp), and then use ```yalsd test.lsp``` to compile and ```node test.lsp.js``` to execute.
